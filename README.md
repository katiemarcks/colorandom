# colorandom

This is a paired programming project I did with Marwa Qari. It is a project from Turing's Module 1. 
The site lets a user create new random color palettes by pressing the "New Palette" button. When a user
likes a certain color, they can lock a color and continue randomizing. Once a user is satisfied with their
palette, they can save to the "Saved Palettes" section. The Hex codes can also be edited manually
by the user. 

Below is the link to the projects specs:
